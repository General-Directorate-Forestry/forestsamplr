The `forestsamplr` package was first created by [SilviaTerra](https://silviaterra.com/bark/index.html), with the intent of building an open source tool for the field of forestry. The functions contained in the package are based on the equations and concepts outlined in several commonly referenced forest inventory textbooks.
